Considering that other names for descendants of Shem also stand for places, Eber can also be considered the name of an area, perhaps near Assyria. A number of mediaeval scholars such as Michael the Syrian, Bar Hebraeus, and Agapius the Historian mentioned the prevailing view, that the Hebrews had received their name from Eber, while also pointing out that according to others, the name Hebrew meant those who cross, in reference to those who crossed the Euphrates river with Abram from Ur to Harran, and then to the land of Canaan."
